# WikipediaTracker
A simple system to track the Wikipedia articles I read. Consists of:

* Flask REST API which writes to and reads from file
* Chrome extension which makes a POST request to Flask API every time I navigate to a Wikipedia page
* Simple demo website displaying the last Wikipedia article I visited
